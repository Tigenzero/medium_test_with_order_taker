# Untested Python Code is Already Broken: An Intro to Testing

### Companion code for an introduction to testing!
## Requirements
- A version of Python 3 is required to setup the virtual environment. The virtual environment will be Python 3.8.
- Optional: Make/Cygwin
- [Medium Article](TBD)

#### In the event that you get stuck, please refer to the Solution folder, which has all the tests explained in the article.

## Troubleshooting
### Python3/pip3 command not found:
If you do not have python3 and pip3 assigned, use python and pip instead. When using the Makefile, replace all references (CTRL+R in Pycharm) from python3 to python and pip3 to pip.
